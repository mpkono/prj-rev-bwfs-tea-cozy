# prj-rev-bwfs-tea-cozy

Our second submitted project for the Codecademy HTML/CSS 10-week course at http://ready.codecademy.com/.

We were given a redline design spec of the site as well as graphics assets to use.
Our project was to recreate the site using the HTML/CSS we had learned in the first five weeks.
My project was submitted to, and reviewed by, Codecademy. You can view the instructor's comments in the Issues tab.

Here is the redline design spec:
